Team Project: 0x11 - C printf

This is a group project at ALX focused on implementing printf in C. The objective is to create a function that produces output based on a given format. The project involves handling various conversion specifiers and custom conversion specifiers.

The conversion specifiers to be handled include: d, i, u, o, x, and X. Additionally, the team is responsible for managing flag characters such as 0 and -, as well as length modifiers like 'l' and 'h'.

To optimize performance, the team will use a local buffer of 1024 characters to minimize the number of calls to the write function. The project also includes handling field width and precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

The custom conversion specifier to handle is: p. Moreover, the team will address custom conversion specifiers as well.

The goal is to successfully implement printf functionality, making it a valuable addition to the ALX software engineering project.
